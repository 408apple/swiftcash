### Introduction
SwiftCash is an open-source, self-funded system of decentralized governance and economy, born out of a desire to create a digital store of value with a consistent and stable growth model, as well as a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency for daily transactional use along with blockchain-based and cheat-proof lotteries. SwiftCash uses the revolutionary Proof-of-Stake algorithm to reach consensus and allows up to 10% of maximum inflation to be spent on proposals that are embraced by enough stakeholders. 20% of maximum inflation goes directly to stakeholders who help secure the network aka Miners and Masternodes, and the rest of maximum inflation which is 70% can go to HODL deposits which are coins locked in the blockchain between 1-12 months.

### Proof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work
The revolutionary Proof-of-Stake algorithm offers a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin, and other Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-Work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by high-powered mining hardware and anyone can attack the network and double spend by acquiring 51% of the networkâ€™s hash power. SwiftCash utilizes the green protocol, an energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake algorithm, which can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. The green protocol offers a simple solution to sustainability issues posed by Bitcoin and other Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies, and provides a faster, and more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.

### Initial Distribution & Inflation
SwiftCash has a unique initial distribution and inflation. Initial distribution was less than 2% of the maximum supply which was airdrops on most SmartCash addresses - the community that gave birth to SwiftCash - details about the initial airdrops can be found in the whitepaper. SwiftCash also has a very unique and smooth inflation with radically slow reduction of block rewards. It takes 4 years for block rewards to halve for the first time and second halving will take an additional 8 years; third halving will take an additional 16 years and so on. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, this halving takes place gradually and slowly at every block rather than suddenly, stripping the markets from pump and dump opportunities, and therefore providing the holders with a consistent and stable growth model.

### Blockchain-Based & Cheat-Proof Lotteries
Lottery tickets can be bought with as little as 0.01 SWIFT. Winners are picked randomly based on a future blockhash. Draws take place every 5,000 block, and each time 3 tickets win; the winning tickets can all belong to the same person bought in just one transaction, as buying more tickets is the only thing that results in higher chances. 80% of the coins spent to buy tickets will become the jackpot and will be distributed among the winners. The first winner will receive 60% of the jackpot, the second winner will receive 30% of the jackpot and the third winner will receive 10% of the jackpot. 16% of the coins spent to buy tickets will be given to SwiftCash Miners and SwiftNodes who find these blocks. And last but not least, 4% of the coins spent on tickets will burn in a deflationary fashion just like transaction fees.

### HODL Deposits - Immitating Term Deposits in Traditional Banking Systems
HODL deposits are designed to imitate term deposits in traditional banking systems. The idea is that users can lock their coins in the blockchain for a set period of time and be rewarded for doing so. HODL rewards come from future inflation, are paid instantly to the locked deposit and they cannot be spent until the deposit matures. The best rate is paid to 12-month deposits which is calculated by 60% of the maximum block rewards during 12 months divided by 80% of the total supply at the time the HODL deposit is made. For deposits less than 12 months, the annual rate is 7% less than the best rate. For example, if the best annual rate is 50% for a 12-month deposit, it will be 46.5% for an 11-month deposit and 43% for a 10-month deposit, etc. There is no minimum requirement for creating a HODL deposit; however, HODL deposit transactions cost 0.1 SWIFT.

- Fast transactions featuring instant locks on zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftTX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting enabling consensus-based advancement of the current SwiftNode
  technology used to secure the network and provide the above features, each SwiftNode is secured
  with a collateral of 50,000 SWIFT.

### Theoretical Block Rewards Distribution (after v3.0 HF/Reset)

| **Block Height** | **SwiftNodes**    | **PoS Miners**     |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 201-1000         | 20% (~2 SWIFT)    | 80% (~8 SWIFT)     | 
| 1001-Infinite    | 20% (~80-2 SWIFT) | 80% (~235-8 SWIFT) |

### Minimum & Maximum Block Rewards

Community proposals will be allowed to use 10% of maximum block rewards for budgetting as calculated with the following formula. 20% goes to PoS Miners and SwiftNodes/Masternodes. The rest which is up to 70% can go to HODL deposits.

Maximum Block Rewards = (4 * 2000 * 52560) / (4 * 52560 + nHeight + 58300 - 1000)

Minimum Block Rewards = (4 * 400 * 52560) / (4 * 52560 + nHeight + 58300 - 1000)
